# CAS-Data-Analytics-Competition

This is the code and slide for CAS Data Analytics Competition. We discuss GLMs, GBMs, and XGBs for claim frequency modeling in our presentation. And a simulation study is also considered. The data freMTPL2freq used in this competition is included in the R package CASdatasets. This project is jointly worked with Yifan Zhang (China life P&C).
